# AURORA — SIH26061 Frontend

AURORA is the frontend command center for **AI-Driven Smart Energy Management System for Polar Research Stations**.

```

## Product screens

- Overview / Energy Command Center
- Live Monitor
- Forecasting
- Optimization
- Fuel Management
- Battery Management
- Reports & Analytics
- Alerts & Events
- Settings
- Help & Documentation

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI starts in simulation mode by default. To connect the FastAPI backend later, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_USE_MOCK=false
```

Expected backend endpoints already referenced by the frontend:

```text
GET  /api/dashboard
POST /api/optimization/run
GET  /api/forecast/load
```

## Design direction

Dark polar-tech command center, cyan/green energy signals, high-contrast operational metrics, dense analytical cards, and operator-first controls. The interface is intentionally designed around the AURORA system architecture: prediction → optimization → simulation → operator decision.
